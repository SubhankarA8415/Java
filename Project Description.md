The atm_project description

running component -> main.java inside src folder. 

Description: This project includes a demonstration of an atm interface with some realistic features. 
There are total 5 operations we can perform
1) Transaction history
2) Deposit
3) Withdraw
4) Transfer
5) Check balance

And the 6 option is to exit from the project. 
I have included file operations to make it more realistic, with this project one needs to create his/her account if it doesn't exists in the database. If accounte exists already then the person is required to log in with the help of correct username and password if he/she does it successfully then he/she will be able to perform all the operations mentioned above. 

There are two category of files included:
1) It is named as data and it is used to store the username, password and balance of the existing user as soon as the user creates his/her account it will be stored in the data.txt file. 
2) And the second file is generated in as username.txt of the existing user and it will be created as soon as the user will do some transactions and this file keeps on storing the transaction history, the history is stored mentioning the type of transaction as debit or credit to his/her account and it will keep on updating the balance in thr file mentioning the date and time of the transaction and whenever the user will terminate the program the final updated balance of the user will get updated in the data.txt file. 

I have tried to handle as much possible exceptions that can be commonly generated during execution of the program.
